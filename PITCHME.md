## How to  Code
+++
### Inline
There are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`.  If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:

    if (isAwesome){
      return true
    }
+++
### Code fencing
GitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:

```
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```
+++
### Syntax highlighting
And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```
